This cli-application demonstrates how to use the Fabric API to deploy items
from git to fabric (using a reference workspace).

Installs with 
```
poetry install
```

Config file should be put at `config/deploy.toml` (don't ever commit this).
Use `config/deploy.SAMPLE.toml` as a reference file.

Runs with 
```
poetry run python main.py
```
